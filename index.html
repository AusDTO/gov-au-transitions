      <p>Answer a few questions about their situation â€“for example whether they wish to stay at home or move to an alternative living arrangement, so we can suggest options to explore.</p>
      <p>We can then guide you through the kinds of decisions you may need to make, and the government support that can help you.</p>
      <p>If you are helping a couple, please complete this set of questions twice.</p>
